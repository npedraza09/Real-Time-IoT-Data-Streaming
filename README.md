This project is designed to enable robust, fault-tolerant data streaming by leveraging Confluentâ€™s Docker image for ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and Control Center. Real-time vehicle location data is produced through a Python client and consumed by a Node.js web server, which visualizes IoT streams in a user-friendly interface. By uniting Docker, Python, and Node.js, the system ensures seamless message production, consumption, and fault-tolerant data handling, illustrating a comprehensive, end-to-end approach to real-time data processing.
